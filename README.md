# depth_blanking_panel
Server Rack blanking panels with configurable depth.
For those times when your hot-side racked equipment doesn't *quite* come far enough into the cold-aisle, to match the simple, traditional blanking panel.  This panel can be set for specific depths from the cold-side vertical posts.

Model designed in OpenSCAD (http://www.openscad.org/).
